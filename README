Assignment 2
I implemented the listed four planets by giving each with their own points and normal arrays to render. However I created a transformation matrix to characterize the size, orbit, and speed as well as the light parameters of the shaders before passing them through the shaders to be drawn. 

I also inplemented one the of the extra credits to draw the moon by transforming its location in respect to the transformation of the blue planet.
